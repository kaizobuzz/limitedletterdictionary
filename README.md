# limitedletterdictionary
uhm just a silly thing for now :3

## What's it for
This was made to find the most number of words that could be created with a limited amount of letters.  
### Initial phrasing 
find the subset X of {m, e, r, o, w} such that the number of the sets in the set {{e, m, o, w}, {m, o, r, w}, {e, m, w}, {e, r, w}} which are subsets of X divided by the number of elements in X is as large as possible
